<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>I have always said to myself that I should start blogging to keep track of things (projects, side-projects, side-projects of side-projects), but I have a terrible memory and end up forgetting that.</p>
<p>This time around I was thinking: - Hey, I should start blogging about something.</p>
<p>But you know what, I really suck at managing this kind of stuff, Jekyll helps quite a lot but I still need to write stuff with markdown.</p>
<p>I am not a huge fan of markdown either, patterns are weird, formatting tables is a mess, no equations, no bibtex (I also miss that when working with Word), and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Every engineer knows the best way to solve problems is to solve the problem for themselves by overengineering a solution (this is meant as a joke... even though it sounds too accurate to be just that...).</p>
<p>So, how can we make things better for ourselves and get some decent syntax for writing somewhat large texts?</p>
<p>Here is a tip: it is in the title of this post.</p>
<p>Yes, we can translate LaTeX into HTML, do some stripping, add a new Jekyll header and make things work nicely.</p>
<p>But how do we do that? Pandoc (Section <a href="#Pandoc" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="Pandoc">2</a>), Jekyll (Section <a href="#Jekyll" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="Jekyll">3</a>) and some script glue (Section <a href="#glue" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="glue">4</a>) written in the best programming language ever: Python.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="Pandoc"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Pandoc</h1>
<p>Of course each one of us could write a LaTeX parser and do the conversion for ourselves (if we had unlimited time, big brains and were determined to do it).</p>
<p>I do not know how about you, but I am of the kind that start writing programs right away just to realize how grand things will end up being.</p>
<p>As usual when doing these things, you realize "ain’t nobody got time for that" <span class="citation" data-cites="AINT_GOT_TIME">(NobodyGotTimeForThis, n.d.)</span>.</p>
<p>Started looking for alternatives. Found <a href="https://github.com/latex2html/latex2html">latex2html</a> and <a href="https://github.com/michal-h21/make4ht">make4ht</a>, which are pretty cool. Tried setting them up, but did not manage to make it work as I wanted. Started looking for more alternatives.</p>
<p>Found a post in <a href="https://www.danwjoyce.com/data-blog/2018/2/20/latex-to-html-via-pandoc">Dr. Joyce’s blog</a>.</p>
<p>Pandoc: An universal markdown translator, which can magically translate a subset of LaTeX+BibTex into HTML+MathJax (yay /o/, equations). It is not perfect, but it also does not need to be.</p>
<p>While I did not quite manage to make equation numbering nor manage citations style/cross-references working correctly, <a href="https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-xnos">pandoc-xnos</a> could make it work. I think it has to do with the glue in Section <a href="#glue" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="glue">4</a>. Maybe I will try again in the future, but for now it is doing what I needed.</p>
<p>The magic command ended up being</p>
<pre><code>    pandoc --number-sections --mathjax -f latex -t html -s --bibliography=file.bib -o file.html file.tex</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p><code>--number-sections</code> for numbered sections</p></li>
<li><p><code>--mathjax</code> to process equations and render using javascript</p></li>
<li><p><code>-f latex</code> to process from LaTeX</p></li>
<li><p><code>-t html</code> to output in html</p></li>
<li><p><code>-s</code> standalone html</p></li>
<li><p><code>--bibliography=file.bib</code> to get references from the bib file</p></li>
<li><p><code>-o file.html</code> to indicate the path to the output file</p></li>
<li><p><code>file.tex</code> to indicate the input file</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="3" id="Jekyll"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Jekyll</h1>
<p>You probably have heard of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> at this point. It is a nice static site generator used by <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, which made a ton of people used to it by default. Jekyll does not support LaTeX documents, but it does accept HTML files as inputs.</p>
<p>By placing the post header in the HTMLs, it will treat the HTML contents as the post content.</p>
<pre><code>---
layout: post # could be a different layout
author: &quot;authorname&quot;
title: &quot;postname&quot;
---</code></pre>
<h1 data-number="4" id="glue"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Script glue</h1>
<p>The final piece is the code glue written in Python. It just scans for <em>.tex</em> files, uses pandoc to convert them, strips out unnecessary HTML header/footer and include the post header expected by Jekyll containing the post author names, title and layout.</p>
<p>If there is a <em>.bib</em> file along with the <em>.tex</em>, it is used as the bibliography source file.</p>
<pre><code>def latex_to_html_via_pandoc(source_file, source_dir=&quot;latex_posts&quot;, target_dir=&quot;_posts&quot;):

    output_file = source_file.replace(&quot;.tex&quot;, &quot;.html&quot;).replace(source_dir, target_dir)

    # Latex to html
    command = &quot;&quot;&quot;pandoc --number-sections --mathjax -f latex -t html -s&quot;&quot;&quot;
    command = command.split(&quot; &quot;)

    # Load references from bib file if it exists
    bibliography = source_file.replace(&quot;.tex&quot;, &quot;.bib&quot;)
    if os.path.exists(bibliography):
        command.append(&quot;--bibliography=%s&quot; % bibliography)  # use external bib file or not

    command.append(&quot;-o&quot;)
    command.append(output_file)  # output path
    command.append(source_file)  # source path

    # Run pandoc
    try:
        subprocess.check_output(command)
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(&quot;Error during pandoc conversion of %s: %s&quot; % (source_file, e))

    # Open the html file and get only contents to let jekyll handle style, links, etc
    with open(output_file, &quot;r&quot;, encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;) as f:
        contents = f.read()

        # extract authors and title
        authors = re_match_html_author.findall(contents)
        author = authors[0]
        authors.pop(0)
        while len(authors) &gt; 0:
            author += &quot;, &quot; + authors[0]
            authors.pop(0)
        del authors
        title = re_match_html_title.findall(contents)[0]

        # Remove unnecessary header and trailer
        contents = contents.split(&quot;&lt;/header&gt;&quot;)[1]
        contents = contents.split(&quot;&lt;/body&gt;&quot;)[0]

    # Rewrite file with markdown header
    with open(output_file, &quot;w&quot;, encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;) as f:
        # Write markdown header
        f.write(&quot;&quot;&quot;---\nlayout: post\nauthor: &quot;%s&quot;\ntitle: &quot;%s&quot;\n---&quot;&quot;&quot; % (author, title))

        # Write stripped down html
        f.write(contents)</code></pre>
<p>After that, you can manually run jekyll build command or jekyll serve (which starts the webserver).</p>
<p>Or run <code>Latex2Markdown.py --serve True</code> to run the LaTeX to HTML, Jekyll build and start service at once.</p>

<p>It works surprisingly well and I am pretty happy with the results.</p>
