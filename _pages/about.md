Hi. I wonder what you were looking for to hit this page...

My name is Gabriel, as you could have guessed by the link and the title. 

I have a Computer Engineer degree and a master's degree in Informatics, both from the University of Bras√≠lia.

During my master's I have worked mainly with wireless communications and network simulations, but I also like
to learn more and work with other stuff. Signal processing and distributed systems are examples.

When I have time, I like to work on open-source projects, especially if I notice performance issues 
(which I think are unacceptable, but completely understand why maintainers prefer to prioritize real features 
and making sure everything is working correctly). If you know one of such projects, send me a message and I will
take a look on what can I do to help.
