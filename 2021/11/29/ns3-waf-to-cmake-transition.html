Maybe, but I do not think they help as much. If it was something interactive, it could be pretty cool. I have tried setting up Jupyter notebooks for more interactive guides using the power of <a href="https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Cling-Xeus</a>.</p> <p>Better examples? Maybe. Some examples are very simple while we have much more complicated scenarios in published papers.</p> <p>Better docs? I personally don’t think they help as much when you’re already lost.</p> <p>Maybe include a parser to be able to describe the simulations from a higher level description language like other simulators do? That does not sound like a bad idea, since setting up some things can be quite complicated if you are just getting started.</p> <p>Better tooling? This is where I come in.</p> <h1 class="unnumbered" data-number="" id="build-systems">Build systems</h1> <p>Something so simple as a build system should not be such a problem, am I right? Well, it is not if you already know what you are doing, how to get things done, etc.</p> <p>If you are part of the group just getting started into everything at once, it is overwhelming and your productivity is basically none for a while, which can be frustrating. I was one of these.</p> <p>So, how bad can it really be? Well, pretty bad. Since I have been used to IDEs, where projects can be organized neatly, settings are managed graphically, auto-completion works, coding mistakes are properly highlighted, you can easily navigate and refactor the code and my preferred feature: VISUAL DEBUGGING.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2021-11-29-ns3-waf-to-cmake-transition/visual_debugging.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="image"></p> <p>Yes, I like visual debuggers. Really like them. For a few reasons, being the following two the main ones:</p> <ul> <li><p>I can see the values of the variables not only in the memory watches panels, but inlined into the code</p></li> <li><p>I can see the callstack</p></li> </ul> <p>But you may ask me: <em>-What the devil build systems got to do with visual debugging?</em>.</p> <p>And that is a pretty good question. While build systems do not prevent you from using visual debuggers, it limits the amount of information and insights you can get from the code. Some IDEs, for example, do not even allow for that.</p> <p>Why all of this matters? <a href="https://waf.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>WAF</strong></a>.</p> <p>Waf is a pretty cool build system written entirely in Python and is supper easy to distribute with your project, so it needs only Python installed (which you would probably already have anyways) and whatever your project needs to get build (e.g. compiler).</p> <p>ns-3 have been using Waf for a while, and it has been working well for quite a long time, which goes to show it is not a bad build system in any way.</p> <p>My grudges with Waf is just that it does not support IDEs and the organization in different steps, plus how things are organized seem overly complicated for me. What I dislike the most however is that it does not produce intermediary build system files that I can inspect visually and discover what I am doing wrong.</p> <p>So I started working on CMake support...</p> <h1 class="unnumbered" data-number="" id="ns-3-with-cmake">ns-3 with CMake</h1> <p>Since I started my masters, my advisor said I should start working with ns-3. If it was not for that, I would probably be using ns-2 or OMNET++.</p> <p>Anyways, so I started rewriting everything ns-3 needed on CMake. Took quite some time to write everything, since I was not only translating Waf, but "reverse engineering". I admit this was pretty stupid, but I simply could not understand how Waf did its magic (if it had written makefiles or something like that, it would have been easier and faster).</p> <p>Since 2018 I have been gathering feedback and refactoring everything to <a href="https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/merge_requests/460" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">upstream that support</a>, which seems like it is going to happen soon (release 3.36).</p> <p>With CMake, all major IDEs are supported from the get go: Microsoft <a href="https://gabrielcarvfer.github.io/NS3/installation/visualstudio" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a> and <a href="https://gabrielcarvfer.github.io/NS3/installation/visualcode" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Visual Code</a>, <a href="https://gabrielcarvfer.github.io/NS3/installation/clion" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jetbrains CLion</a>, <a href="https://gabrielcarvfer.github.io/NS3/installation/xcode" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Apple XCode</a>, <a href="https://gabrielcarvfer.github.io/NS3/installation/codeblocks" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code::Blocks</a>, <a href="https://gabrielcarvfer.github.io/NS3/installation/eclipse" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Eclipse</a>, CodeLite and others.</p> <p>Of course CMake can also be called directly via <a href="https://gabrielcarvfer.github.io/NS3/installation/terminal" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the command-line</a>, but commands are very verbose.</p> <p>Command-line users will be happy to know they were not forgotten with the <a href="https://gabrielcarvfer.github.io/NS3/installation/ns3waf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ns3</a> wrapper script for CMake (previously known as fakewaf and ns3waf). The script provides pretty much the same functionality expected from Waf, including exporting library paths, making programs just work instead of having to export the path first.</p> <p><strong>My suggestion</strong>: use the ns3 wrapper when you need it. For example, when using IDEs that do not natively support CMake projects such as Xcode, Code::Blocks and Eclipse, you will need to specify the proper CMake Generator to get a project for them. Also, you will need to close the IDE, refresh the CMake cache manually (re-run ’ns3 configure’) whenever you add/remove a source file, create a new module or add a new dependency (either module or library), then you can open the IDE once again and continue using. I know it is pretty bad and that is why I suggest either CLion (my preferred IDE) or VsCode, which works surprisingly well with CMake.</p> <h2 class="unnumbered" data-number="" id="what-changes-for-a-module-developer">What changes for a module developer?</h2> <p>Not that much. I have purposefully made it very similar to make the transition as smooth as possible. Copy and paste source lists to the appropriate variables, then clean semicolons and quotes and you are good to go if your module does not have any special needs (e.g. external library or options).</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/2021-11-29-ns3-waf-to-cmake-transition/modules_transition.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="image"></p> <p>If you need user-provided paths to look for libraries, you can follow example from the brite:</p> <pre><code>    # This part is similar the conf part in a wscript

    #    (a.k.a. this value won't be lost accross runs)
